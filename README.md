# Manual-testing-of-rokomari.com
Rokomari.com is a Bangladeshi e-commerce site. It officially launched on 19 January 2012. Initially, it started selling only books, but now sells DVD, video tutorial, sporting goods, calculator, watch, pen drive, computer accessories and more. Being a popular online bookselling website in Bangladesh, it is expected to have almost no bugs in its registration and login pages. However, I thought of manually testing its registration and login pages to verify every feature and started working on it in order to develop my test case writing and test execution skills.
